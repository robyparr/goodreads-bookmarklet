# goodreads-bookmarklet
A replacement for the official Goodreads bookmarklet.

The official Goodreads bookmarklet sometimes chokes up when the Amazon URL uses the ASIN instead of ISBN-13.

This bookmarklet parses the page, looking for the ISBN-13 or ASIN if ISBN-13 isn't available.

## Requirements
This bookmarklet uses some ES6 features so may not work correctly on all browsers.
